If you are reading this, it means that you are one of whom can <b>See</b>, yet also be <b>Seen</b>.
It also means that you are able to See <b>Him</b>. <b>He</b> who was banished by the new gods for aboniable power and simultaneous lack of care for that which surrounds <b>Him</b>.

A demon to many; a <b>god</b> to those past. An elevated Being, brought down to the least of moral lows by the premise of pillage and wager; the idea of victory, at first consisting of conquest of worlds, but now, no more than boasting and swagger.
It is then how He decended to your <b>Plane</b>, taking form after the first being to become known to <b>Him</b>. Now bounded by a mere nth-dimensional shell, He roams, seeking those who may contest him, for any prize, once more.

<b>But beware:</b> in spite of his lost status as <b>Warleader</b> of the <b>Ancients</b>, of <b>Him</b> is the desire to seek stakes of the grandest nature.
Though limited in values to respect friendly competition, once engaged in a true challenge, the pillars of what you have, can, and will ever know, will be nearly destined to be consumed.
